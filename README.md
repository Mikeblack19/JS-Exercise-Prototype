# Constructors, Prototypes and _this_

## JavaScript Fundamentals

## Objectives

- explain the four principles of the 'this' keyword and demonstrate each explanation with an example of their uses
GLOBAL 
WHEN IN THE GLOBAL SCOP THE VALUE OF 'THIS' WILL BE THE WINDOW; AS FAR AS A USE  CASE IM NOT SURE. 
IMPLICIT BINDING 
IMPLICIT BINDING MEANS 'THIS' IS ASSIGNED TO THE OBJECT TO LEFT OF THE DOT. THIS IS PROBABLY WHAT MAKES JAVASCRIPT AN OBJECT ORIENTED LANGUAGE AND IT USE CASES ARE IN PASSING AS MANY PARAMETERS TO A THE FUNCTION OF AN OBJECT AS YOU NEED. 
NEW BINDING 
NEW BIND REFERS TO THE KEYWORD NEW USED AFTER DECLARING A VARIABLE BUT BEFORE INVOKING THE CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION BEING ASSIGNED TO THE VARIABLE. WE USE CONSTRUCTORS OR OBJECT CREATIONS WHEN WE WANT TO BE ABLE CHANGE OUT THIS FOR ANY VARIABLE WE DECLARE. THAT WAY WE CAN USE PROPERTIES OF THE OBJECT ALONG WITH PASSING A PARAMETER 
EXPLICIT BINDING 
IS JUST THAT WE EXPLICITALLY BIND THIS TO A NEW VARIABLE. 

- describe, and use prototypes, constructor functions the new keyword, and pseudo-classical inheritance to build objects

## Introduction

In order to complete these tasks you will need your newly aquired knowledge of constructor functions, prototypes, and the `this` keyword.

## Instructions

### Task 1 - Set up Project

  1. Fork repo
  1. Clone _your_ fork (not Lambda's repo by mistake!).
  1. `cd` into your newly cloned repository.
  1. Create a new branch by typing `git checkout -b <firstName-lastName>`.
  1. Install dependencies by typing `npm install`.
  1. Run tests by typing `npm run test:watch`.
  1. Work on your branch, push commits and create PR as usual.

### Task 2 - MVP

Find the file `index.js` and complete tasks 1, 2 and 3 until all of your tests pass.
There is an additional task 4 which requires written explanations and has no tests.

If you run into trouble while coding, fight the good fight for 20 minutes and then get on the help channel. __Remember to formulate your help request in a professional manner__ - like you would at the job - by including error messages, screenshots, and any other pertinent information about the problem, as well as what things you have attempted already while trying to solve it.

### Task 3 - Stretch 

There are stretch goals found throughout `index.js`. Do not start work on these until you have finished MVP.
